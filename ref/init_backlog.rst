Product Backlog
===============

Summary
=======

This is the initial product backlog, produced in collaboration with various administrators using interview strategies.

In conformity with Scrum practice, the top-most stories are the most urgent.

Tasks
=====

* Break "epics" into smaller stories

* Add detail as necessary

    The trick is to add detail to user stories in a way that is productive for the team. As decribed in the Scrum section of this reference -

    Detail can be added to user stories in two ways:

    * By splitting a user story into multiple, smaller user stories.

    * By adding “conditions of satisfaction.”

* Collaborate to determine estimates for chosen tasks

* Keep in mind that the *backlog* may change during sprints.

Initial Stories
===============

1. As a user, I can print IEP progress reports without truncated progress narratives.

2. As a user, I can view and print IEP progress reports without backslashes appearing in the reports.

3. As an administrator, I can have all users' passwords stored in the database with encryption (instead of in plain text).

4. As a user, I can report on an IEP every quarter in a new record.

5. As an administrator, I can archive an old IEP and start a new IEP for every student.

6. As a user, I can report on IEP progress in a specific discipline without scrolling through every discipline available.

7. As an administrator, I can "brand" (uniquely distinguish) the system to modify the interface as well as the printed reports.

8. As an administrator, I will have thoroughly validated and standardized HTML, CSS, and PHP.

9. As an administrator, I will have a product that is fully documented for extensibility and modification by future developers.

10. As a user, I can be confident that the product is supported by Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera.

11. As a user, I can access and interact with the system on mobile devices.

12. As an administrator, I will have documentation to guide me through administrative tasks of the product.

13. As an user, I will have thorough documentation so I get the most value out of the product.
